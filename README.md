In this project, I have created a personal website with three web pages: a
homepage, a page displaying my resume, and a page featuring my short biography.
I have also created a short .html page that redirects my Tufts CS website to
the personal webpage that I have created.

I think that I have correctly implemented all of the major aspects of the
project. I think my web pages could be a little more stylish but I am hoping
that we will learn more about that in the future.

The only person I collaborated with was Ming when I went to his office hours for
help. He was very helpful.

I spent approximately 5 hours working on this assignment.
