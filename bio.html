<h1> Cathy Cowell </h1>
<h2> A short biograpy </h2>

<p class = "bio" > I was born on a cold December night in Philadelphia. The day after I was
  born the city experienced more rain than had fallen on any single day in the
  previous decade. I grew up in a rowhouse in South Philadelphia, raised by
  my parents who were teachers and in the company of my older brother. When I
  was in fourth grade my parents applied for me to go to a special middle school
  which was called Masterman. When I was accepted many adults told me
  that I was smart. I attended Masterman middle school continued
  through High School and ended up graduating with honors. In the Fall of
  2015, I matriculated into Tufts University in Medford, MA, where I currently
  reside. At Tufts, I study Computer Science and Education and hope to be a
  teacher one day.
